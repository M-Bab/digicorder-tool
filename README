Technisat Digicorder Communicator and Transcoder

A python tool for downloading/uploading files from/to a Technisat Digicorder and fast and lossless transcoding of mpeg-ts.

Detailed description:
This python-based command line tool allows download & upload of recorded videos from/to a Technisat Digicorder via network

Additionally it allows a fast and lossless conversion of the .ts-files to DVD-compatible .mpg-files (using projectx and mplex) and the .ts4 HD-videos to 
.mkv-files which can be read by any DivX-Plus compatible device (using ffmpeg). The file transcoding functionality is independent from the Technisat functionality
and should work with any SD (which is typically a mpeg2 in mpeg-ts container) or HD (which is typically H264/AVC in mpeg-ts container) digital TV stream.  

If you have questions don't hesitate to contact me (in English or German)

Requirements:
* Python 2.7
For transcoding
* ffmpeg available in system PATH
* projectx available in system PATH
* mplex available in system PATH

Installation:
* Simply unpack it to a preferred destination
* On Linux its recommended to activate the execution bit on main_technisat_digicorder.py
* On Linux/Windows it can be helpful to make main_technisat_digicorder.py available in the system PATH

Configuration:
* Set the correct ip-address of the Technisat Digicorder in the 3rd line of main_technisat_digicorder.py (This will be replaced by a config file in the near future)

Execute/examples (">" indicates a command line interface):
* > main_technisat_digicorder.py --help
	Gives you information about available options
* > main_technisat_digicorder.py --list
	Connects to the digicorder and lists the available main directories
* > main_technisat_digicorder.py --list --cd recordings
	Connects to the digicorder and lists all elements available in the folder "recordings" = Lists all recordings
* > main_technisat_digicorder.py --get 3 --localdirectory=/home/peter/video
	Downloads the element ID=3 (you get the ID with the list command above) to the local directory /home/peter/video
* > main_technisat_digicorder.py --ts4tomkv /home/peter/video/bigbangtheory
	Transcodes the .ts4 files (HD-video recording) in /home/peter/video/bigbangtheory to an .mkv in the same directory
* > main_technisat_digicorder.py --tstompg *
	Wildcard expansion of course also works: This transcodes all .ts files to .mpg files in all subdirectories of your current directory

Todo:
* More feedback/progress indicators when downloading/transcoding
* Upload files to technisat
* Delete files on technisat
* Configuration file for Technisat ip and location of ffmpeg, projectx and mplex binaries
